 Developed a Python-based simulation to model fractional flow behavior in petroleum reservoirs.
• Utilized NumPy for numerical calculations and Matplotlib for visualizing key relationships.
• Plotted graphs of relative permeability vs. water saturation and fractional flow vs. water saturation to analyze variations in flow
behavior with changing reservoir properties.
